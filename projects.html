                <h2>EnsembAudit (EA)</h2>
                <p>EnsembAudit introduces a novel framework that autonomously identifies and rectifies common labeling 
                    errors in object detection annotations using ensemble techniques. EA addresses critical challenges within
                    the Computer Vision and Machine Learning domains. EA is established using Python and YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) 
                    tech stack.
                </p>
                <p>This research project was conducted in collaboration with Delft University of Technology. 
                    Detailed training methodologies, results, and validation data are available for further exploration.</p>

                <p>This project represents a RESTful web service that implements CRUD functionality for managing
                    companies, projects and tasks. Task management application that allows employees to collaborate more
                    efficiently with one another. Essentially a Github style project architecture but for everything non
                    CS related!</p>
                <p>A fully-fledged backend architecture developed using Java and Spring Boot Framework. The frontend for
                    the system is under development.</p>

                <h2>Artificial Neural Network</h2>
                <p>The ANN has two layers, an input layer, and an output layer, and is trained using the backpropagation
                    algorithm with stochastic gradient descent optimizer. The project uses a dataset with 7000 samples
                    and 10 features each, and the performance of the model is evaluated based on the accuracy on the
                    test dataset.</p>
                <p>This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for multiclass classification in Python
                    using Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.</p>

                <h2>Discord Bot with NLP</h2>
                <p>Harumi is a versatile Discord bot that keeps servers entertained and engaged. With a variety of
                    functionalities, the bot can respond to multiple commands, translate any language to English, and
                    chat naturally with the user. Currently, the bot is under development with plans to introduce a
                    fully fledged game system, more responsive features for Discord servers, and moderator type
                    features.</p>
                <p>The bot is developed in Python 3.9 and is hosted 24/7 via Replit.com.</p>
